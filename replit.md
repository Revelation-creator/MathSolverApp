# Overview

This is an Advanced Mathematics Solver web application built with Flask that provides comprehensive mathematical problem-solving capabilities. The application offers a user-friendly interface for solving various types of mathematical problems including basic arithmetic, quadratic equations, systems of equations, algebra, trigonometry, calculus, matrix operations, and graphing functions. It features step-by-step solution explanations and visual representations using matplotlib for graphs and charts.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a multi-page interface built with HTML5, Bootstrap 5, and vanilla JavaScript. The frontend is organized into tabbed sections for different mathematical domains (basic math, quadratic equations, systems, algebra, trigonometry, calculus, matrices, and graphing). The interface leverages MathJax for rendering mathematical expressions and Chart.js for visualizations. Custom CSS provides a modern gradient-based design with smooth animations and responsive layouts.

## Backend Architecture
The backend follows Flask's modular structure with clear separation of concerns:
- **app.py**: Main Flask application initialization and configuration
- **routes.py**: HTTP route handlers for different mathematical operations
- **math_solver.py**: Core mathematical computation engine using SymPy
- **main.py**: Application entry point for deployment

The MathSolver class encapsulates all mathematical operations and provides a clean interface for solving expressions, equations, and performing calculations. Error handling is implemented throughout with proper logging for debugging.

## Mathematical Engine
The core mathematical capabilities are powered by SymPy for symbolic mathematics, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib for graph generation. The solver supports:
- Expression parsing and evaluation
- Equation solving with step-by-step explanations
- Quadratic equation solutions
- Matrix operations
- Calculus operations (derivatives and integrals)
- Trigonometric functions
- Graph plotting with base64 encoding for web display

## Static Asset Management
Static files are organized in the standard Flask structure:
- **static/css/**: Custom styling with CSS variables for theming
- **static/js/**: Client-side JavaScript for interactive features
- **templates/**: Jinja2 templates for HTML rendering

The application uses CDN resources for external libraries (Bootstrap, Font Awesome, MathJax, Chart.js) to reduce bundle size and improve loading performance.
